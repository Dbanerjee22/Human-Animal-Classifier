# Human-Animal-Classifier
This ResNet will identify weather the given image is Human or Animal and then it will save the picture in Different Folder.
README
1.	First, we will process the input image.
2.	Reshape the image.
3.	Create labels so that our ResNet can categorized the image understand the difference.
4.	Convert the class into one hot encoding.
5.	Shuffle the dataset and then split the data set into Train and validation.
6.	Create a custom ResNet model.
7.	Evaluate the Test image and the put the image in the appropriate container.
